                <p> WalzEQ was my first real website that I developed for when I worked at my first internship. The site
                    was originally wrote in old ASP code. The employer requested that I convert the code to full HTML.
                    How I did that was up to me. I decided it was best to start the website from scratch and port over
                    the non-ASP code such as JavaScript.</p>

                <p> I rebuilt the website from scratch and made it to look exactly
                    like it was when it was written in ASP. </p>

            <div class="description_2" data-file="texthide">
                <p> The 401 Water Street website was the second project I worked on while I was at my first internship.
                    I was creating the website for the first time for this client.  I was given a bare-bones CSS template
                    to use while creating this website.  This site featured a slide-show, contact form, and
                    3D birdseye view of the location.  In order to add to the sites look, I took some pictures
                    on my personal time to add to the site. </p>

                <p>
                    This was my first attempt to build a website without a pre-existing one to model off of.  It took
                    some time getting comfortable having a lot of say on the design of the website.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="description_3" data-file="texthide">
                <p> The Junction City Art Fair website was one of my last projects at my first internship.
                    The website was non-existing at the time and I was requested to build it.  I did have a
                    Peoria sister art site template to work with to create the site.  This site was a little bit easier
                    to build than the previous sites I built during my internship because of my increased
                    level of knowledge of web design.

                <p> During the Skills USA Web Design State Competition in Illinois, my teammate and I were tasked with
                    putting together a functional website within a short period of time that met the requirements of the
                    judges.  We had 6 requirements we had to meet as well as use the chosen theme.  This was my first
                    time in a competition and I was really nervous.  I put together some forms, a list of SEO techniques,
                    and some other HTML.  I knew I wasn't comfortable with coming up with all the CSS in the short period
                    of time.
                </p>
                <p> Since my partner could understand my nervousness at the competition, he gave me some really good
                    advice.  He told me "If you want to get really good with CSS you need to build a website from scratch
                    without using a template."</p>

                <p>
                    Using the advice I received from my partner at the Skills USA competition, I set out to make a website
                    from scratch to polish my CSS skills.  Since my brother was in need of a company website for his
                    landscaping business, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to build a website template using
                    HTML and CSS.  I added some JavaScript features such as a slideshow and the dropdown menu, which I
                    did not write from scratch.  However my goal to develop a functional website using CSS and HTML was
                    met with praise and was a success.

                    This project took a very long time to accomplish being my first commercial website I built from
                    scratch.  Although it wasn't the prettiest of websites, the experiences I learned from this project
                    are used to this day.

                <p>
                    When the Burke Outdoor Services website was completed, I later learned that my brother needed to
                    be able access the content and make changes for the new seasons.  To remedy this, I felt that using a
                    Content Management System or CMS is the way to go.  This would allow the user to control the content,
                    without needing to use any code.  I picked Joomla as the CMS for the website and we choose a premade
                    template to customize to his needs.  The website was more easier from my brother to control the
                    content and looked a bit more professional.  Since I was using a template along with my new refined
                    skills with CSS, I was able to get this website up and going in just a few weeks.  I was pleased with
                    the overall outcome and the experience I got with working with a CMS.

                    When I started school at ISU, I begin my first job there as a Drupal Web Developer.  Drupal was a
                    different CMS than I was use to, but it wasn't too hard to adjust to since I had previous experience
                    with Joomla as a CMS.  ISU was going through a series of upgrades. One of the first tasks that I
                    needed to do was create a dynamic Service Catalog using XSLT/XML on Drupal.  I had no previous
                    knowledge of using XSLT or even know what it meant, but I was motivated by the challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a few weeks, I was able to complete the Service Catalog in Drupal.  The catalog went from being
                    a very large static page with anchor tags to navigate, to a Service Catalog that has searches done
                    alphabetically, or by categories.  I was pleased with the results as well as my supervisor and met
                    with praise.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="description_8" data-file="texthide">
                <p>
                    The next project that I focused on while I was working at ISU was a big project.  ISU was integrating
                    a new version of Drupal into their ecosystem. With the new version required major overhaul of the
                    existing websites.  Since the previous Drupal version templates were not compatible with the new
                    version of Drupal, we had to integrate a completely new template.  ISU needed to bring an outside
                    designer to create the template to give to us to integrate in their website.  Sounds easy, but I
                    assure you their quite a lot of problems you wouldn't expect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The designer created the template and sent it to ISU by their deadline regardless of how
                    complete it was.  It definitely fell short of a complete design.  Regardless, my coworker and I had
                    to find a way to fix the mess we were given by the designer and then integrate it into the system as
                    well as create sub-site templates based off of the original design in just a few weeks, while
                    attending our classes full time.  It was a challenging task of time management, separation of duties,
                    troubleshooting, and a good eye for detail.  Luckily ISU picked the right guys for the job.  My
                    coworker specialized in the backend, while I specialized with the frontend dealing with CSS, HTML,
                    and the CMS.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With a lot of hard-work I finished the project.  I was the CSSAfter the project was completed,
                    it was met with praise from our supervisor and was showcased at ISU's quarterly meeting a few weeks
                    later.

                    A project that I worked on, from the beginning of my position at ISU to the end of my term was
                    working on the LEAP forward website.  This website was an existing website for ISU that needed to go
                    through many changes since the leadership for LEAP did not like the existing site.  Some changes
                    required were redesigning the navigation, restructuring all the content on the pages to fit the
                    new website organization, and other Drupal tweaks.

                    Burke Outdoor Services was doing well with the current site.  However the Joomla version was phased
                    out of support that year and in order to be updated to the latest version, required a new template as
                    well as a complete overhaul of the website.  This was important since security of the website would
                    be at risk if Joomla would no longer support the version we were using.  We also wanted to have a
                    website that would support mobility so we wanted a template that is responsive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I set out to find a template that I could redevelop into the website that Burke Outdoors could use
                    as their website.  Having now a lot of experience with customizing websites, I was able to choose a
                    template from a very limited selection since Joomla 3.0 was just released shortly after I needed to
                    upgrade to that version.  With that template I was able to rebuild it into the Burke Outdoors site in
                    a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some extra features that were added to the site were a categorized services page, a more quicker and
                    functional photo-gallery, a contact form that is connected with the clients email, and a google maps
                    feature to show the location of the business.
